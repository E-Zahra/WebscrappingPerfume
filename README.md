**Perfume packaging isn’t just about looks—it can give clues about the fragrance inside! This project explores the connection between a perfume’s cover design, its characteristics, and how it actually smells.**

**We’ll gather data from the web, analyze different perfume attributes, and see if there’s a link between packaging colors and scent types. By taking a data-driven approach, we’re turning raw information into valuable insights that help us understand how visual design relates to fragrance perception.**

## Agenda:
**here you see:**

***1- using beutifulsoup to scrap perfumes (name, collection, price, customer_rating, head_note, heart_note, base_note, description, character, fragrance)***

***2- using beautifulsoup, PIL/Pillow, scikit-learn's K-means for scraping photoes of perfumes and resizing the images***

***3- using math to convert RGB to human colors for further analysis***

***4- merging both csv file (the color of package and information about perfumes)***

***5- cleaning the dataset and preparing it for association rules mining***

***6- performing association rules to see the relation of different aspect of perfumes***
